# Scheming

Working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Using vim, when i get stuck i go to DrRacket.

I have a question tho, how do i tell the `racket` executable that i want a specific extension of some language ??

IE how to translate `#lang scheme` to the racket executable ?

# ToDo #

There are couple of things i should note (as of 2019-04-12)
    - I will redo some exercises that are more on the challenging side, because i want the full experience TM.
    - I will list them soon.

## Important sections of the book I've seen so far ##

Here are :
- Some of the sections i have either skipped because they were too hard for me at the time.
- Still hard for me RN.
- Sections that i completed but that are about concepts important enough for me to redo them.
- Sections i liked.

### Square roots by newton's method ###

### 1.2.3 Orders of Growth ###

### 1.2.6 Testing for optimality ###

### 2.1.4 EXTENDED EXERCISE : INTERVAL ARITHMETIC ###
 This one particularly spooked me, dunno if it was warranted or not

### Symbolic differentiation ###
Which, coincidentally, i am working on at the moment of writing this (2019-04-12 14:58)
### Sets as trees ###
And all of the trees shenanigans
### HUFFMAN TREES ###
Need to see if i can actually, ... you know ... *USE* this thing instead of just implementing encoders/decoders that take/spit out a list of symbols .... :weary:

In particular, need to pass the encoding function a *string*, not *a list of symbols* because i cant automate that.
#### YES, USE STRING->SYMBOL ####
Why didn't i think if that beforehand :sweat_smile:

### Data-directed programming ###
I think I understand the general concept, but I think it's still fuzzy in my mind.

Might be due to the fact that i didn't do the exercises ...

### New types vs New operations ###
Hmmm, this is some vague bullshit, i understqnd it somewhat but need
to revisit
Message-passing vs Data-directed method

### Section 2.5 : Generic operations (YET AGAIN) ###

Exercices 2.82, 2.83, 2.84, 2.85, 2.86

Seem somewhat complicated, and seem like the "extension-type" exercises that give you deeper understanding of the topic. 

## Note ##

There are still a number of individual exercises that i will record for posterior practice.

Particularly, i will probably revisit the exercise i skipped at some point.

Also note that there are a bunch of folders that start with 2-80...

Those are when i was frustrated with the use of a mutable data structure so i rolled my own immutable version.

I then started doing all the other exercices i skipped.
