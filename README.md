Working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

This repo is now being simultaneously posted to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/zenAndroid/scheming-sicp) and [GitHub](https://github.com/zenAndroid/wannabe-schemer).
Occasionally jotting down my thoughts about the material.

Using vim, when i get stuck i go to DrRacket.

I have a question though, how do i tell the `racket` executable that i want a specific extension of some language ??

IE how to translate `#lang scheme` to the racket executable ?

# ToDo #

There are couple of things i should note (as of 2019-04-12)
    - I will redo some exercises that are more on the challenging side, because i want the full experience TM.
    - I will list them soon.

## Important sections of the book I've seen so far ##

Here are :
- Some of the sections i have either skipped because they were too hard for me at the time.
- Still hard for me RN.
- Sections that i completed but that are about concepts important enough for me to redo them.
- Sections i liked.

### Square roots by newton's method ###

### 1.2.3 Orders of Growth ###

### 1.2.6 Testing for primality ###

### 2.1.4 EXTENDED EXERCISE : INTERVAL ARITHMETIC ###

 This one particularly spooked me, dunno if it was warranted or not

## Note ##

There are still a number of individual exercises that i will record for posterior practice.

Particularly, i will probably revisit the exercise i skipped at some point.

Also note that there are a bunch of folders that start with 2-80...

Those are when i was frustrated with the use of a mutable data structure so i rolled my own immutable version.

I then started doing all the other exercises i skipped.
