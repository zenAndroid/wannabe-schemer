Not going to bother with the first part of the question ...


As for the second, if my understanding is correct the possible resulta are
first sets x to (* 10 10) iE 100.
second sets x to (* 100 100 100) iE 1000000

or first sets x to (* 10 10 10) iE 1000
second sets x to (* 1000 1000) iE 1000000

Both cases x becomes 1000000




i may be a bit slow today ... :(
