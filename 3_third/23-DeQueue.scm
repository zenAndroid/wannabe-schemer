Defining procedures for the creation and manipulation of doubly linked lists.
PS: DLL = Doubly Linked List

Exercise 3.23: A deque ("double-ended queue") is a sequence
in which items can be inserted and deleted at either the
front or the rear. Operations on deques are the constructor
"make-deque", the predicate "empty-deque?", selectors
"front-deque" and "rear-deque", mutators
"front-insert-deque!", "rear-insert-deque!",
"front-delete-deque!", and "rear-delete-deque!". Show how to
represent deques using pairs, and give implementations of
the operations. All operations should be accomplished in
Theta(1) steps.

(define (DLL-element element)
  (list '() element '()))

(define (prev dll-element)
  (car dll-element))

(define (val dll-element)
  (cadr dll-element))

(define (next dll-element)
  (caddr dll-element))

(define (make-deque) (cons '() '()))

(define (front-deque deque) (car deque))

(define (rear-deque deque) (cdr deque))

(define (set-front-ptr! deque item)
  (set-car! deque item))

(define (set-rear-ptr! deque item)
  (set-cdr! deque item))

(define (empty-deque? deque)
  (or
    (null? (front-deque deque))
    (null? (rear-deque deque))))

Going to introduce list-set!
