; One annoying thing I'm facing with the ambiguious evaluator is that I can't
; do something like (ambeval '(S-EXPRESSION ...) the-global-environment), I
; will see if I can gather something from Eli or something.
; And if it doesn't work out then I guess it's not that big a loss ... *would*
; be nice if I could do it though

; Oof, by the way you need require and distinct?


; WARNING TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE READING; this file is NOT for being loaded by
; guile as is, the ONLY line of code that gets read by GUILE/RACKET/what have
; you is the LOAD line, all the other lines are not for the guile/underlying
; scheme's evaluator, but for the AMG evaluator.  Caveat Emptor.

; BLESS VIM-SLIME (altho you can paste stuff from a window to a terminal fine
; using just built-in vim tbh)
